# The Anchoring effect

**def. Anchoring is a type of [[Nudge]] that anchors in your mind a certain value, number or idea before you make a decision. Afterwards your choices will be closer to an anchored value even if they aren't related at all.**


### example:
Ask if Ghandi was older or younger than 102 years old when he died. People with a bigger suggested number will give a bigger answer than the other group.


### Comments:
- Less knowledge about a subject one has, the stronger Anchoring effect will be.
