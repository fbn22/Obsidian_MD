# Protolab

## Student LinkðŸ”—
1. Protolab contacts a company and asks if they have any task that they need to perform that MD students could help them with (graphic design, poster, video, logo, UI/UX, simple code, idea or solution to an existing problem, branding).
2. Protolab takes this task and announce a Protolab challenge/competition at Business Academy. We run a campaign promoting this event around the school for 1-2 weeks. Depending on a size of a challenge, students will be allowed to participate in groups or on their own.
3. Time for completing a challenge will be dependent on the size of the particular task given by a company. 1-2 weeks.
