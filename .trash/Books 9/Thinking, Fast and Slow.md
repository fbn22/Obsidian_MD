```ad-quote 

 "Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi proposed a word - "FLOW" for it. People who experienced it, describe it as "a state that doesn't require a struggle of attention - total absorption, so deep that you lose a track of time, forget about problems and even yourself"." (Page 57)
    - Note: FLOW state
