# Utilitarianism

### 📍 Definition 
 _**Utilitarianism** is a family of normative ethical theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being for all affected individuals. It focuses on the results of actions, and treats intensions as irrelevant. Utilitarianism is a version of [[Consequentialism]]. 
 Proponents of utilitarianism have disagreed on a number of points, such as whether actions should be chosen based on their likely results [[Act Utilitarianism]], or whether agents should conform to rules that maximize utility [[Rule Utilitarianism]]._

 **The principle of utility** states that actions or behaviors are right in so far as they promote happiness or pleasure, wrong as they tend to produce unhappiness or pain.

 ##### Key proponents
 [[Jeremy Bentham]]
 [[John Stuart Mill]]
 Henry Sidgwick
 Peter Singer
 
### 🔎 Example
- ACT vs RULE Utilitarianism in case of condemning a terrorist:
Act Utilitarian: "What possible good or evil results from this single act?"
Rule Utilitarian: "Is there a justified rule or law that condemns terrorist to death?"

### 📝 Notes
