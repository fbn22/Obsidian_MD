# Rule Utilitarianism

### 📍 Definition 
 _Invented by [[John Stuart Mill]], **Rule-utilitarianism** claims that **we ought to live** by rules that, in general, are **likely to lead** to the **greatest good** for the **greatest number**. It is a reaction to the [[Act Utilitarianism]]. _

 For rule utilitarians, the correctness of a rule is determined by the amount of good it brings about when followed. In contrast, act utilitarians judge an act in terms of the consequences of that act alone, rather than judging whether it faithfully adhered to the rule of which it was an instance.
 
 An act is morally right if it conforms to a justified **moral rule**.

### 🔎 Example
- Following a rule of not killing will bring more long-term utility to the society than short-term action of not killing, because it won't tolerate exemptions based on circumstances.

- ACT vs RULE Utilitarianism in case of condemning a terrorist:
Act Utilitarian: "What possible good or evil results from this single act?"
Rule Utilitarian: "Is there a justified rule or law that condemns terrorist to death?"


### 📝 Notes
- To formulate a perfect rule, it would require to include a great amount of exceptions to be applicable in practical situations.

- Suppose that for every country, the best traffic rule is to keep to the right. According to rule-utilitarianism, I ought to keep to the right. Suppose I am in Britain and know that people will generally keep to the left...Ought I really to keep to the right?

- Rule Utilitarianism maximizes utility for a long run by following stable rules, where Act Utilitarianism considers only short run actions.
