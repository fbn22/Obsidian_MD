# Act Utilitarianism

 ### 📍 Definition 
 _Invented by [[Jeremy Bentham]], **Act utilitarianism** claims that in **any given situation**, you should choose the **action** that produces the **greatest good** for the **greatest number**. 
 Act utilitarianism is sometimes called **quantitative utilitarianism**. It’s called quantitative because it’s about quantifying happiness – adding up all the happiness and subtracting all the pain – and then deciding how to act based on the numbers._

 [[Jeremy Bentham]] provides the **Felicific Calculus** as a way to calculate utility in this way:
-   **Intensity:** how strong the pleasure is
-   **Duration:** how long the pleasure lasts
-   **Certainty:** how likely the pleasure is to occur
-   **Propinquity:** how soon the pleasure will occur
-   **Fecundity:** how likely the pleasure will lead to more pleasure
-   **Purity:** how likely the pleasure will lead to pain
-   **Extent:** the number of people affected

### 🔎 Example
- If two different courses of action lead to two different intensities of pleasure, then the ethically right course of action is the one that leads to the more intense pleasure.

- The consequences of the act of giving money to charity would be considered right in act-utilitarianism, because the money increases the happiness of many people, rather than just yourself.

- ACT vs RULE Utilitarianism in case of condemning a terrorist:
Act Utilitarian: "What possible good or evil results from this single act?"
Rule Utilitarian: "Is there a justified rule or law that condemns terrorist to death?"

### 📝 Notes
- Difficult to calculate
- Difficult to apply in practice / Impractical
- Tyranny of the majority
- Too idealistic
-  **Felicific Calculus** tries to quantify happiness which is impossible
- Moral status of particular relationships
