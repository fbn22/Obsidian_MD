# Qualitative Separation of Pleasures

### 📍 Definition 
 _Proposed by [[John Stuart Mill]] in opposition to **quantitative utilitarianism** and [[Felicific Calculus]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]]. 
 Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference […] that is the more desirable pleasure. Distinction for higher and lower pleasures._

**Higher pleasure** is a higher pleasure if it would be chosen over another pleasure even if it was accompanied by discomfort and if it would not be traded with a higher quantity of the other pleasure.

### 🔎 Example
- A minute of being with a loved person is a higher pleasure to a taste of good meet, no matter in what quantity.

### 📝 Notes
- Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal, whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures **higher pleasures** are superior to more physical forms of pleasure **lower pleasures**.

- He defines **higher pleasures** as mental, moral, and aesthetic pleasures, and **lower pleasures** as being more sensational. He believed that higher pleasures should be seen as preferable to lower pleasures since they have a greater quality in virtue. 

- Pleasures gained in activity are of a higher quality than those gained passively.
