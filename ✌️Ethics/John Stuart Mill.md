####  📜Quotes
>“It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.”

>“Though the consequences in the particular case might be beneficial—it would be unworthy of an intelligent agent not to be consciously aware that the action is of a class which, if practiced generally, would be generally injurious, and that this is the ground of the obligation to abstain from it.”

>If I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or what makes one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a pleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one possible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference […] that is the more desirable pleasure.

### 📝 Notes
- Mill's major contribution to utilitarianism is his argument for the [[Qualitative Separation of Pleasures]]. Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal, whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures **higher pleasures** are superior to more physical forms of pleasure **lower pleasures**.

- He defines **higher pleasures** as mental, moral, and aesthetic pleasures, and **lower pleasures** as being more sensational. He believed that higher pleasures should be seen as preferable to lower pleasures since they have a greater quality in virtue. He holds that pleasures gained in activity are of a higher quality than those gained passively.

- **Higher pleasure** is a higher pleasure if it would be chosen over another pleasure even if it was accompanied by discomfort and if it would not be traded with a higher quantity of the other pleasure.
