### ⚜️Bio
**Jeremy Bentham** (1748-1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and social reformer regarded as the founder of modern [[Utilitarianism]]. Provided the [[Felicific Calculus]] for the sake of quantitative measuring and comparing the degree of happiness or pleasure that a specific action can produce. Teacher and mentor of [[John Stuart Mill]]. His [[Act Utilitarianism]] can be boiled down to three claims:

-   Whether an action is right/good or wrong/bad depends solely on its **consequences**
-   The only thing that is good is **happiness**
-   No individual’s happiness is more important than anyone else’s
