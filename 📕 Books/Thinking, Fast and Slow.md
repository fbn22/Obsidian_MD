### 🎨 Most important lessons
- Human beings have two thinking systems: System 1 and System 2.

**System 1** works automatically, without effort or with a little effort, we don't experience a feeling of conscious control over it.
**System 2** distributes necessary attention between actions requiring mental effort, like complicated calculations. Subjective feeling of focus, free choice and conscious actions.

- When we focus or think our pupils gets wider, but when we stop they get small again.
