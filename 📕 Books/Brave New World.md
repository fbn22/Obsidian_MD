### 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
A dystopian vision of the future where people are being control by elites through social and genetic engineering. World controllers keep people in a constant state of happiness and dominance high to make then obedient. A Savage man from a natural world experience living in a dystopian society where everything is perfect and grows mad by its lack of soul and character.

### 🎨 Most important lessons
- In the pain, struggle and work people can develop their character and question reality but in constant comfort, pleasure and amusement we start to become obedient, indifferent followers without a purpose and that leads us to a feeling of desire towards running away from that reality through mind-altering substances (soma).

- Society is indeed divided into Alphas, Betas and Epsilons. There is no point in trying to convince Epsilons to see the real world as they are genetically limited. You should only seek to be surrounded by Alphas. Find your Iceland.

- Totalitarianisms can be achieved not by brutally crushing citizens [[1984]] but also though subtle social engineering and keeping it's citizens in a constant amusement. Consumerism, drugs, sex, food, pleasure and dopamine are means of subtle social control.

- Anti social behaviors (do not mistake with a lack of social skills) can be a sign of high state of awareness, individualism and intellectual superiority.

### 📒 Summary
Satiric, dystopian view on the possible version of the future totalitarian society built on a constant amusement, basic desire, social engineering and conditioning. 
Society in it's quest for social equality and stability is fundamentally devoid of emotion, beauty, intelligence and love. World controllers rule the world through the social and genetic engineering, not by force. Citizens are being kept in a state of constant clinical happiness through drug called 'Soma' which they voluntary take as it is a pure dopamine. Society is divided into classes created by genetic engineering and social conditioning. Consumerism replaced religion. Religion, art, history and science only creates emotions that are a root of destabilization in society.

### ☘️ How the Book Changed Me
It helped me to realize that social conventions and pressure from society influence the most those who are the weakest and least mentally capable. It thought me that it is in individual education, struggle and exploration where an Alpha character grows.

### ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes

>And that, put in the Director sententiously, that is the secret of happiness and virtue—liking what you’ve got to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.


### 📝 Notes
- Soma is a drug that party uses to keep it's citizens obedient in a state of constant happiness. It kills all the anxiety, pain and stress.

- Society genetically engineered into intellectual classes(Alphas, Betas, Deltas, Epsilons) and each class was given jobs adequate to their mental capacities. Alphas can't be given Epsilon's jobs like factory work because they would go mad by their awareness.

- People who were too conscious, intelligent and incapable of living in a dumb society were sent to Iceland as a punishment. It was a punishment from a perspective of a unconscious person but in reality it was full of intelligent and remarkable individuals.

- Everybody lives in a bottle but some people bottle is just larger

- Savage ad A conscious man preferred danger and struggle to comfort and cleanliness because he saw beauty in it.

- Being a truly conscious Alpha means to be in a sense outcaste from society. To be sent to the Iceland. But there you can find others like you.

- To create an obedient society you should satisfy all their primary needs, make them intoxicated with work suited to their mental capabilities and offer them endless party, sex, drugs and fun so they won't have time to question reality. Keep them in a constant dopamine high.
- Total repression of individualism. Total group think.

- Consumerism replaced religion.

- Babies are being conditioned through 2 techniques: Neopavlovian and Hypnopedia.

- Religion, art, history and science only creates emotions that are a root of destabilization in society.
