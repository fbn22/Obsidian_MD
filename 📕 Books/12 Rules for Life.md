### 📝 Notes

### 📜 Quotes

> "When you have something to say, silence is a lie."

> "To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality."

> "And if you think tough men are dangerous, wait until you see what weak men are capable of."

> "It took untold generations to get you where you are. A little gratitude might be in order. If you're going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have your reasons."

> "No tree can grow to Heaven,” adds the ever-terrifying Carl Gustav Jung, psychoanalyst extraordinaire, “unless its roots reach down to Hell."

> "The successful among us delay gratification. The successful among us bargain with the future."

> "Nietzsche said that a man’s worth was determined by how much truth he could tolerate"

> "Always place your becoming above your current being."

> "People organize their brains with conversation. If they don't have anyone to tell their story to, they lose their minds. Like hoarders, they cannot unclutter themselves."

> "It is my firm belief that the best way to fix the world—a handyman’s dream, if ever there was one—is to fix yourself."

> "Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed. Say only those things that make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with honour."

> "If you cannot understand why someone did something, look at the consequences—and infer the motivation."

> "What you aim at determines what you see."
