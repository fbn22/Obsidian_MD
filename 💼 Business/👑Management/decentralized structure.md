# decentralized structure

### 📍 Definition 
 _Type of an [[Organizational Structure]] that gives individuals and teams high degrees of autonomy without needing a core team to regularly approve business decisions._

### 🔎 Example
```ad-example
A good example of this decentralized structure is Johnson & Johnson. With thousands of products and lines of business, the company structures itself so each business unit operates as its own company with its own president.
```

### 📝 Notes
- Even in decentralized companies, there are still usually built-in hierarchies (such as the chief operating officer operating at a higher level than an entry-level associate). However, teams are empowered to make their own decisions and come to the best conclusion without necessarily getting "approval" from up top.
- Popular among tech startups.
- Allows companies to remain fast, agile, and adaptable, with almost every employee receiving a high level of personal agency.
