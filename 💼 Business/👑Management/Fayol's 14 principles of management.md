# Fayol's 14 principles of management

1.  Division of work - In practice, employees are specialized in different areas and they have different skills. Different levels of expertise can be distinguished within the knowledge areas (from generalist to specialist). Personal and professional developments support this. According to Henri Fayol specialization promotes the efficiency of the workforce and increases productivity. In addition, the specialization of the workforce increases their accuracy and speed. This management principle of the 14 principles of management is applicable to both technical and managerial activities.
2.  Authority and Responsibility - According to Henri Fayol, the accompanying power or authority gives the management the right to give orders to the subordinates.
3.  Discipline - This principle is about obedience. It is often a part of the core values of a mission and vision in the form of good conduct and respectful interactions.
4.  Unity of command - Every employee should receive orders from only one superior or on behalf of the superior.
5.  Unity of direction - Each group of organisational activities that have the same objective should be directed by one manager using one plan for the achievement of one common goal.
6.  Subordination of Individual Interest to General Interest - The interests of any one employee or group of employees should not take precedence over the interests of the organisation as a whole.
7.  Remuneration - All Workers must be paid a fair wage for their services. The wages paid must be as per a certain standard of living to the employee at the same time it is within the paying capacity of the company.
8.  Centralization and Decentralization - This refers to the degree to which subordinates are involved in decision making.
9.  Scalar chain - The line of authority from top management to the lowest ranks represents the scalar chain. Communications should follow this chain. However if someone needs to communicate some other person in emergency he/she might use "Gang Plank". â‰¤Fayol suggested the concept of â€˜Gang Plankâ€™ to avoid delays and allow direct communication between two subordinates at the same level.â‰¥
10.  Order - this principle is concerned with systematic arrangement of men, machine, material etc. There should be a specific place for every employee in an organization. That is 'a place for everything (people) and everything has a place'.
11.  Equity - All the employees in the organization must be treated equally with respect to the justice and kindliness.
12.  Stability of tenure of personnel - High employee turnover is inefficient. Management should provide orderly personnel planning and ensure that replacements are available to fill vacancies.
13.  Initiative - Employees who are allowed to originate and carry out plans will exert high levels of effort.
14.  Esprit de corps - Promoting team spirit will build harmony and unity within the organization.
