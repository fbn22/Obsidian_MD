### ⚜️Bio
**Henri Fayol** (1841 – 1925) was a French mining engineer, mining executive, author and director of mines who developed a general theory of business administration that is often called Fayolism. He and his colleagues developed this theory independently of [[scientific management]] but roughly contemporaneously.
