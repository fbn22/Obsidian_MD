### 📝 Notes
- The structure defines the hierarchy within a company or organization
- Who is responsible for what?
- Who should be helping whom in case of difficulties?
- Successful organizational structures define each employee's job and how it fits within the overall system.
- A centralized structure has a defined chain of command, while decentralized structures give almost every employee receiving a high level of personal agency.
- Not having a formal structure in place may prove difficult for certain organizations. For instance, employees may have difficulty knowing to whom they should report. That can lead to uncertainty as to who is responsible for what in the organization.
