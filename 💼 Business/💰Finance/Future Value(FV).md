# Future Value(FV)
``` ad-definition 

 _**Future value (FV)** is the value of a current asset at a future date based on an assumed rate of growth. It can be calculated by two formulas: Simple interest formula and Compound Interest formula_

```
### Simple interest formula:
``` ad-note
title: $$ FV = I × (1+(R × T)) $$
**I = Investment amount
R = Interest rate
T = Number of years**
```

 ### Compound interest formula:
``` ad-note
title: $$ FV = I × (1 + R) ^ T $$
**I = Investment amount
R = Interest rate
T = Number of years**
```

### 🔎 Example
```ad-example
I put $10000 worth of Crypto on a staking account with an APY = 8% for 5 years, with an automatic reinvestment after each year set. This will be a Compund Interest Formula.

$$ FV = I × ((1 + R) ^ T) $$
$$ FV = 10000 × (1 + 0.08) ^ 5 $$
$$ FV = 14.693 $$


```

### 📝 Notes
- The future value is important to investors and financial planners, as they use it to estimate how much an investment made today will be worth in the future.
- External economic factors, such as inflation, can adversely affect the future value of the asset by eroding its value.
- Future value (FV) is the value of a current asset at some point in the future based on an assumed growth rate.
-  Investors are able to reasonably assume an investment’s profit using the FV calculation.
- Determining the FV of a market investment can be challenging because of market volatility.
- There are two ways of calculating the FV of an asset: FV using simple interest, and FV using compound interest.
