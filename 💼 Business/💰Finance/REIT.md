# REIT

### 📍 Definition 
 _A **Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)** is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. Modelled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn [[dividend]] from real estate investments - without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves._

### 📝 Notes
-  REITs generate a steady income stream for investors but offer little in the way of capital appreciation.

-  Most REITs are publicly traded like stocks, which makes them highly liquid (unlike physical real estate investments).

-  REITs invest in most real estate property types, including apartment buildings, cell towers, data centers, hotels, medical facilities, offices, retail centers, and warehouses.

- Most REITs have a straightforward business model: The REIT leases space and collects rents on the properties, then distributes that income as dividends to shareholders.
