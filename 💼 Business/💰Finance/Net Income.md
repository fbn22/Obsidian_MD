# Net Income
**def. Net income (NI), also called net earnings, is calculated as sales minus selling, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, depreciation, interest, taxes, and other expenses.**

- [[Earnings per share]] are calculated using NI.

- Investors should review the numbers used to calculate NI because expenses can be hidden in accounting methods, or revenues can be inflated.

- Net income (NI) is known as the "bottom line" as it appears as the last line on the income statement once all expenses, interest, and taxes have been subtracted from revenues.
