### 📝 Notes
- With cost, insurance, and freight, the seller covers the costs, insurance, and freight of a buyer's order while in transit.
-   Once the cargo has been delivered to the buyer's destination port, the buyer assumes responsibility for the costs of importing and delivering the goods.
-   However, the risk transfer occurs from the seller to the buyer when the goods have been loaded on the vessel.
-   The buyer takes ownership of the goods once on the ship, and if the cargo is damaged during transit, the buyer must file a claim with the seller's insurance company.
- Usually, exporters who have direct access to ships will use CIF
