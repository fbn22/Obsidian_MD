# Dividend

### 📍 Definition 
 _A **dividend** is the distribution of some of a company's earnings to a class of its shareholders, as determined by the company's board of directors. Common shareholders of dividend-paying companies are typically eligible as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend date._

### 📝 Notes
- A dividend is the distribution of corporate profits to eligible shareholders.

- Stocks with high growth potential generally reinvest earnings, rather than pay out dividends, and high dividend yield stocks aren’t always safe.

- Dividends are payments made by publicly listed companies as a reward to investors for putting their money into the venture.

- Announcements of dividend payouts are generally accompanied by a proportional increase or decrease in a company's stock price.

- Larger, more established companies with more predictable profits are often the best dividend payers.

- Many companies do not pay dividends and instead retain earnings to be invested back into the company.

- Some struggling companies that don’t produce enough operating cash flow use high dividends to attract new investors to finance their operations.

- When companies generate positive income they have two options: (1) reinvest the money, or (2) distribute the money to shareholders.
