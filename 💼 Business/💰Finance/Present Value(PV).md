# Present Value(PV)
``` ad-definition 

 **Present value** is the concept that states an amount of money today is worth more than that same amount in the future. In other words, money received in the future is not worth as much as an equal amount received today.

```
## Present Value Formula
``` ad-note
title: $$ PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)^n} $$
**FV = Future Value
r = Rate of return/discount rate - interest you could get on that amount during that time
n = Number of periods**
```
### 🔎 Example
```ad-example
To illustrate, consider a scenario where you expect to earn a $5,000 lump sum payment in five years' time. If the discount rate is 8%, you want to know what that payment will be worth today.

$$ PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)^n} $$
$$ PV = \frac{5000}{(1+0.08)^5} $$
$$ PV = 3363 $$


```
