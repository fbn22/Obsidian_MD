# EBITDA
### 📍 Definition 
 _(**Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization**), is a measure of a company's overall financial performance and is used as an alternative to net income in some circumstances. EBITDA, however, can be misleading because it strips out the cost of capital investments like property, plant, and equipment._

### 🔎 Example
```ad-example
Net Income

**$20,000,000**

Depreciation Amortization

+$10,000,000

Interest Expense

+$5,000,000

Taxes

+$5,000,000

**EBITDA**

**$40,000,000**

```

### 📝 Notes
-   EBITDA can be used to compare companies against each other and industry averages.
- Many investors use EBITDA to make comparisons between companies with different capital structures or tax jurisdictions
- The best way to determine whether a company's EBITDA is "good" is to compare its number with that of its peers—companies of similar size in the same industry and sector.
