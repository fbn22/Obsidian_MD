# Thoughts on society

## Social Classes
### The Ruling Class
- There is a ruling class and always has been. A small number of people subtly rule over the world using economics and social [[Nudge]] Technics. This class is far less than 1%. It's just a couple of hundreds of people maybe less that make all the important decisions in the world. These are billionaires, media moguls, a few politicians, Arab kings, oligarchs, biggest landowners, etc. Not necessarily the wealthiest but the most powerful and the best connected. (Kissinger, Trump, Putin, Rockefeller, Gates, Larry Fink)

### The Upper Class
- The upper class consists of millionaires, businessmen, managers, etc. Wealthy people but without any power. Working for someone bigger. The highest servants of the kings.

### The Middle Class
- The middle class does all the work and pay all the taxes. They are often financially stable after saving for some years. They either have solid jobs or run small businesses. They live a happy, normal, stable life with a satisfying paycheck.

### The Lower Class
- The lower class struggle with financial stability, they often live paycheck to paycheck.
