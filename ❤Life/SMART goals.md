# SMART [[goals]]
**def. A goal setting technique created to optimize their efficiency**

## [S]pecific 🎯
Be as clear and specific as possible with what you want to achieve. The more narrow your goal, the more you’ll understand the steps necessary to achieve it.

**Example:** “I want to earn a position managing a development team for a startup tech company.”

## [M]easureable 📊
What evidence will prove you’re making progress toward your goal? For example, if your goal is to earn a position managing a development team for a startup tech company, you might measure progress by the number of management positions you’ve applied for and the number of interviews you’ve completed. Setting **milestones** along the way will give you the opportunity to re-evaluate and course-correct as needed. When you achieve your milestones, remember to reward yourself in small but meaningful ways.

**Example:** “I will apply to three open positions for the manager of a development team at a tech startup.”

## [A]chievable 🏅
Setting goals you can reasonably accomplish within a certain timeframe will help keep you motivated and focused. Before you begin working toward a goal, decide whether it’s something you can achieve now or whether there are additional preliminary steps you should take to become better prepared.

**Example:** “I will update my resume with relevant qualifications, so I can apply to three open positions for the manager of a development team at a tech startup.”

## [R]elevant 📌
When setting goals for yourself, consider whether or not they are relevant. Each of your goals should align with your values and larger, long-term goals. If a goal doesn’t contribute toward your [broader objectives](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/objective-vs-goal), you might rethink it. Ask yourself why the goal is important to you, how achieving it will help you and how it will contribute toward your long-term goals.

**Example:** “To achieve my goal of being in leadership, I will update my resume with relevant qualifications so I can apply to three open positions for the manager of a development team at a tech startup.”

## [T]ime-bounded ⏱️
An end-date can help provide motivation and help you prioritize. For example, if your goal is to earn a promotion to a more senior position, you might give yourself six months. If you haven’t achieved your goal in that timeframe, take time to consider why. Your timeframe might have been unrealistic, you might have run into unexpected roadblocks or your goal might have been unachievable.

**Example:** “To achieve my goal of being in leadership, I will update my resume with relevant qualifications so I can apply to three open positions for the manager of a development team at a tech startup this week.”
