# Porter’s Generic Strategy

### 📍 Definition 
 _Introduced by [[Michael Porter]] in 1980. It’s comprised of three basic strategies, namely the “Cost Leadership Strategy,” “Differentiation Strategy” and “Focus Strategy.” Porter indicated that every company or organization should only pursue one of these strategies or risk wasting company resources in a futile attempt to grow the business fast._

 **Cost Leadership Strategy** - The first of Porter’s Generic strategies focuses on the pricing side of the business. The targets of the strategy are price-conscious customers. It’s an approach where the company provides a quality product that is on par with the competition for a lower price.
 
 **Differentiation Strategy** - The next strategy aims to show the difference between your products and its competitors. While there are price-conscious customers, there are also those who don’t care about the price as long as they get high-quality products. This is where the Differentiation strategy comes in. You provide the best features that your product possesses. This generic strategy is much more effective if you have something that the other products don’t have.
 
 **Focus Strategies** - The last of the three strategies is called Focus strategies. The scope of this strategy includes specific consumers. This means that it is not highly recommended for huge companies, but they can employ it on top of either differentiation or low-cost strategies. Using the Focus strategy, companies can focus more on providing specific products that cater to the specific needs of a consumer group. That is why it is highly applicable for smaller businesses with less competition since it aims to provide unique and exclusive products and services.
