# Second Brain article
You take in about 60 bits of information when talking with someone. To put that into context, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the man who popularised the “flow state,” says the brain can take in an estimated 120 bits of information a second. So you can barely process talking to two people at once. There is so much input; you are bound to forget most of it at a rapid rate.

Did you ever realize that students at school have been studying almost the same way since the first universities were created in 990? We go to university, we sit, we listen, we take notes from what we hear, we read, we take notes from what we've read, we try to make sense of all that, we go to a test, we pass(or not). Doesn't it feel slightly weird that we've been taught in school to take our notes and learn from them exactly the same way as our ancestors who didn't even know that Earth was round? If you think about what they had at their disposal compared to what we have. The only form of physically storing information was written text in their textbooks. Today we have not only written text but also print. We can record voice, video, we have pictures. We have access to an unlimited database of all the information ever discovered by a human species, and yet we take our notebooks, go to school, listen to a teacher, take notes, read books, try to remember and pass the exam. If Sir Isaac Newton was here in 2022 today and saw how most people learn his eyes would probably get the size of apples.


Our short term memory has a limit between 15 and 30 seconds. Or between 1 and 2.2 seconds when your girlfriend asks you to wash the dishes. 

How many times were you in a situation when you got a wonderful idea and a moment later it was gone only because you weren't at the situation comfortable enough to pull up your notebook and write it down? Of course from those situations we have been saved by note-taking apps on our phones. Easily accessible, simple text editors. Yes, they are pretty cool... for a time.

Surprisingly to me, I meet lots of people who still take their notes with "good old fashioned pencil and notebook". I would be blind of course if I couldn't acknowledge a class and some magic in this solution. It is true, it is good, it is fashionable... and it's old. Like thousands of years old. The first writing instrument called a stylus was made from non-toxic graphite was used to write down notes on papyrus by ancient Romans. I often hear (usually from English and history teachers) that this solution lasted so long because it is absolutely the best. Like alcohol. Almost. But you get the point. This is actually a strong argument. It all depends on what is your goal in writing your notes. It has been scientifically proven that most people remember things slightly better when they write them down by hand. This is however not the only factor defining a good note-taking technique. For personal use, I highlighted 5 main factors I consider in choosing a note-taking system that suits my needs.

### 5 factors of a note-taking system
1. Speed of typing

3. Accessibility
4. Edibility
5. Shareability
6. Remembering

If you are a veteran passionate of learning (or a medical student) then you have probably discovered by now that after a while, your note-taking apps become a huge pile of unorganized random thoughts. I for instance read quite a lot of books and take quite a lot of notes.  
 

**Hypomnema** - greek for A note

According to Michel Foucault, "The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditations.


2. Graphite and papyrus - Stylus - Ancient Romans
3. Graphite in the sticks and paper- First pencils - England, 16th century
4. 


Studies comparing the performance of students who took handwritten notes to students who typed their notes found that students who took handwritten notes performed better on examinations, hypothetically due to the deeper processing of learned material through selective rephrasing instead of word-for-word transcription which is common when typing notes.(1)
