# Second Brain article
You take in about 60 bits of information when talking with someone. To put that into context, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the man who popularised the “flow state,” says the brain can take in an estimated 120 bits of information a second. So you can barely process talking to two people at once. There is so much input; you are bound to forget most of it at a rapid rate.

Did you ever realize that students at school have been studying almost the same way for since the first universities were created in 990. We go to university, we sit, we listen, we take notes from what we hear, we read, we take notes from what we've read, we try to make sense of all that, we go to a test, we pass(or not). Doesn't it feel slightly weird that we've been taught in school to take our notes and learn from them exactly the same way as our ancestors who didn't even know that Earth was round? If you think about what they had at their disposal compared to what we have. The only form of physically storing information was written text in their textbooks. Today we have not only written text but also print. We can record voice, video, we have pictures. We have access to an unlimited database of all the information in ever discovered by a human species, and yet we take our notebooks, go to school, listen to a teacher, take notes, read books, try to remember and pass the exam. If Sir Isaac Newton was here in 2022 today and saw how most of people learn he's eyes would probably get the size of apples.
