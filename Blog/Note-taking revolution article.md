# Note-taking revolution article
Our short term memory has a limit between 15 and 30 seconds. Or between 1 and 2.2 seconds when your girlfriend asks you to wash the dishes. You take in about 60 bits of information when talking with someone. To put that into context, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the man who popularised the “flow state,” says the brain can take in an estimated 120 bits of information a second.(1) So you can barely process talking to two people at once. There is so much input; you are bound to forget most of it at a rapid rate.

How many times were you in a situation when you got a wonderful idea and a moment later it was gone only because you weren't at the situation comfortable enough to pull up your notebook and write it down? Of course from those situations we have been saved by note-taking apps on our phones. Easily accessible, simple text editors. Yes, they are pretty cool... for a while.

Surprisingly to me, I meet lots of people who still take their notes with "good old fashioned pencil and notebook". I would be blind of course if I couldn't acknowledge a class and some magic in this solution. It is true, it is good, it is fashionable... and it's old. Like thousands of years old. The first writing instrument called a stylus was made from non-toxic graphite was used to write down notes on papyrus by ancient Romans. I often hear (usually from English and history teachers) that this solution lasted so long because it is absolutely the best. Like alcohol. Almost. But you get the point. This is actually a strong argument. However, it is not the only factor that makes a note-taking system good or bad. I highlighted 5 main factors I consider when choosing a note-taking system that suits my needs.

## 5 factors of a note-taking system
#### 1. Speed of typing
In this category, there is no surprise. Even if you consider yourself a slow typer, an average handwriting speed is around 13 words per minute and average typing speed is around 40 words per minute. With a little bit of practice and proper hand placing on your keyboard, you can easily triple this score. Note-taking is all about transferring information that you have in your mind into a more reliable system in the fastest way possible. It is rather clear that a solution that can speed up this process at least 3 times, should get more credit in the 21-st century.

#### 2. Remembering
It has been scientifically proven that most people remember things slightly better when they write them down by hand. This is however not the only factor defining a good note-taking technique.

#### 3. Customization
Traditional notes on paper give a lot of freedom when it comes to the form of your note, you can write whatever you want and draw whatever you want, it all seems alright until you compare it to the digital note-taking system. In a modern system you can easily connect not only text and drawings but also images, icons, videos, links to websites, not even mentioning options of customizing colours and fonts for highlighting. This kind of flexibility allows you to store your thoughts in a way that Plato couldn't even dream of.

#### 4. Shareability
I remember years ago when was a kid, it happened once in a while that I skipped a few days of school. After great days of freedom as a good student, of course, I had to catch up with all the notes. Usually, I would just go to one of my friends, borrow their notebooks and copy their notes. Cool, but as you probably already know, reading somebody's notes can sometimes be a more daunting task than decoding German Enigma. Today you can easily send a picture of your notes, which makes the whole process much faster, but not necessarily easier. It still can be an Enigma, you just receive it faster. This problem is totally eliminated when you can just simply share your notes to a friend as a PDF or any given format directly from your note-taking app. Once again, practicality wins.

#### 5. Accessibility
Here comes the factor that to me is probably the most crucial one. If you are a veteran passionate of learning (or a medical student) then you have probably discovered by now that after a while, your note-taking apps become a huge pile of unorganized random thoughts. I for instance read quite a lot of books and take quite a lot of notes.  Accessibility is a problem not only when you take traditional notes but also in most of the digital notes taking systems. Whether you highlight a quote in a book or take notes from a lecture in a word document and then place a note to a "School" folder when you have a solid number of notes it doesn't matter how well organized your notes are. You still have to find a specific book, folder, file, page, line and sentence you wanted to find. This is where the game had to change. This is where modern note-taking software proves its superiority. You can just simply type a word, a tag or author you want to find and the system will show you where it is exactly. This small feature may seem like nothing to some people but in my life, it has been an absolute game-changer!

It can be overwhelming of course but it is the right time to stop hiding behind the most common excuse that stops people from improving their learning process  - "I like that classic touch". Too many people stick to what they are comfortable with only because they are not willing to spend a moment and learn a new system. Think about it this way, if Plato or Newton were here today, would they reject trying tools that maximally optimize learning processes for the sake of "this classic, old fashion touch"?

Studies comparing the performance of students who took handwritten notes to students who typed their notes found that students who took handwritten notes performed better on examinations, hypothetically due to the deeper processing of learned material through selective rephrasing instead of word-for-word transcription which is common when typing notes.(2)
