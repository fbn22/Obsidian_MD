# History of notes
1. Plato notes

I want you to think about the way you learn and study things currently in your life. When you encounter a new term or a concept you really want to remember. What do you do? If you are like 99% of society then you probably will try to remember it or write down some notes about it, then try to remember them and then put your notes or a notebook on the shelf. There would be nothing bad about it, except... except the fact that nothing changed in the process for hundreds of years where the technology made us live in the world that ancient Greeks wouldn't even dream of. Images, videos, voice recordings, internet, software and apps. The biggest difference is probably the way we search for information. The Internet has given us a remarkable opportunity.

In the past few years we observed a revolutionary breakthrough, however. People in the first time since Plato moved from notes 1.0 to notes 2.0. 

## Notes eras
#### Notes 1.0
Handwritten on paper. Stored in the physical notebooks. (Ancient Greeks - 1990)
#### Notes 2.0
Typed in a document editor on a computer. Stored in named folders on a hard drive or a cloud.(1990 - 2010)
#### Notes 3.0
Typed or recorded from any IoT device. Stored in one system with an internal search engine and notes linking system. (2010 - present)
#### Notes 4.0 (possible future)
Advanced hybrid between text and sound turned into text. Recorded from any device. Auto generated script from lectures, conversation into a written form. Sound -> Text, Text -> Sound. Visualisation of discussed topics, images, characters.
