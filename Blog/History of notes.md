# History of notes
1. Plato notes

I want you to think about the way you learn and study things currently in your life. When you encounter a new term or a concept you really want to remember. What do you do? If you are like 99% of society then you probably will try to remember it or write down some notes about it, then try to remember them and then put your notes or a notebook on the shelf. There would be nothing bad about it, except... except the fact that nothing changed in the process for hundreds of years where the technology made us live in the world that ancient Greeks wouldn't even dream of. Images, videos, voice recordings, internet, software and apps. The biggest difference is probably the way we search for information. The Internet has given us a remarkable opportunity.

Did you ever realize that students at school have been studying almost the same way since the first universities were created in 990? We go to university, we sit, we listen, we take notes from what we hear, we read, we take notes from what we've read, we try to make sense of all that, we go to a test, we pass(or not). Doesn't it feel slightly weird that we've been taught in school to take our notes and learn from them exactly the same way as our ancestors who didn't even know that Earth was round? If you think about what they had at their disposal compared to what we have. The only form of physically storing information was written text in their textbooks. Today we have not only written text but also print. We can record voice, video, we have pictures. We have access to an unlimited database of all the information ever discovered by a human species, and yet we take our notebooks, go to school, listen to a teacher, take notes, read books, try to remember and pass the exam. If Sir Isaac Newton was here in 2022 today and saw how most people learn his eyes would probably get the size of apples.

In the past few years we observed a revolutionary breakthrough, however. People in the first time since Plato moved from notes 1.0 to notes 2.0. 

## Notes eras
#### Notes 1.0
Handwritten on paper. Stored in the physical notebooks. (Ancient Greeks - 1990)
#### Notes 2.0
Typed in a document editor on a computer. Stored in named folders on a hard drive or a cloud.(1990 - 2010)
#### Notes 3.0
Typed or recorded from any IoT device. Stored in one system with an internal search engine and notes linking system. (2010 - present)
#### Notes 4.0 (possible future)
Advanced hybrid between text and sound turned into text. Recorded from any device. Auto generated script from lectures, conversation into a written form. Sound -> Text, Text -> Sound. Visualisation of discussed topics, images, characters.
